# Kanban â€“ Project Management System
![Kanban Board Preview](board2.png)
## Overview

The Kanban Project Management System is a full-stack application designed to help teams organize tasks efficiently using the Kanban methodology. The application offers features such as task organization, drag-and-drop functionality for seamless workflow management, and secure authentication using JWT tokens.

This project is built with **Next.js** on the frontend for server-side rendering (SSR) and **Node.js/Express** on the backend for API and business logic. **PostgreSQL** is used for the database, and **TypeORM** is leveraged for ORM-based database management.

## Features

- **Task Organization**: Easily organize tasks into columns like *To-Do*, *In Progress*, and *Completed*.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Move tasks between columns smoothly to reflect changes in status.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication system with access and refresh tokens for authorization.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Share the Kanban board with teammates and stay in sync with live updates.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: React framework with server-side rendering for fast performance and SEO.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that provides optional static typing.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for the backend.
- **Express**: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.
- **TypeORM**: ORM for managing PostgreSQL database with TypeScript support.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.

### Other Tools

- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware for handling OAuth with Google.
- **Nodemon**: Tool that automatically restarts the backend server during development.

## Installation & Setup
